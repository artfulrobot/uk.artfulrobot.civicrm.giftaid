# CiviCRM Simple UK Gift Aid Extension

## There's several Gift Aid extensions, what does this one do?

1. **Track Gift Aid eligibility** based on a contact's declarations.

2. **Find donations to claim for** and manage which donations have been claimed.

3. Help with **making a claim** by providing a spreadsheet (CSV) suitable for
   copy-and-pasting into an Inland Revenue claim spreadsheet.

4. Help you **maximise your claim by using aggregation rules** to enable you to
   claim Gift Aid on contributions that a lack of data (e.g.  address) would
   have otherwise prevented you from claiming.


It does NOT:

- automatically do anything. It's a tool to assist you in a fiddly task, not a robot.

- do online submissions to HMRC.

- take responsibility for the quality of your data. This is a tool for people
  qualified to process Gift Aid claims to get things done more efficiently. If
  you use it incorrectly the Inland Revenue will hunt you (or more likely, your
  supporters) down like a dog and this extension cannot be held liable.
