# Installing and Requirements

## Requirements

This extension has been written against CiviCRM 4.7 with PHP 5.6 and MariaDB
10.0 (MariaDB is a drop-in replacement for MySQL that I have found to be more
performant than MySQL for CiviCRM, a recent version of MySQL should work just as
well), it requires InnoDB and UTF-8 support.

I have used it in Drupal and Wordpress setups.

Any problems running against other versions please [submit an
issue](https://github.com/artfulrobot/uk.artfulrobot.civicrm.giftaid/issues) and ideally
a pull request :-)

## Download and install the extension

Download as a ZIP/tgz file (or clone the repo) from

<https://github.com/artfulrobot/uk.artfulrobot.civicrm.giftaid/releases>

Anwyay, you want to end up with a directory called
`uk.artfulrobot.civicrm.giftaid` within your CiviCRM extensions directory.

Then visit *CiviCRM » Administer » System Settings » Extensions* and install it.
